1)Crop Yield Prediction:  Crop Yield Prediction can be done using crop yield data, nutrients and location data. These inputs are passed to Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms. These algorithms will predict crop based on present inputs.
2)Fertilizer Recommendation: Fertilizer Recommendation can be done using fertilizer data
